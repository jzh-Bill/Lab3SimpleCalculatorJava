Hey guys please do not share this link to all other students since this repository contains all the code of lab3.

This repository has two branchs, one is master, and the other is switch_block_version branch.
  - The master branch is the most basic solution showon on the slides.
  - The switch_bock_version is a more advacned solution which used switch code block rather than customise all the button click function.
    However, there is one issue for using "R" in switch code block due to this version of Android Studio. And its solution is to add
    one line of code "android.nonFinalResIds=false" in "gradle.properties", REMEMBER, don't forget to click the gradle turtle on your left up corner screens "sync project with gradles file"
    Then the issue should be gone.
